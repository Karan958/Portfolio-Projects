# Portfolio-Projects
The Data-Analysis-Toolkit repository is a comprehensive collection of projects that encompass various aspects of data analysis, including web scraping, data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and SQL queries using different tools and technologies. The repository contains the following projects:

## Amazon Web Scraper:
This project focuses on scraping data from the Amazon website, specifically extracting product information, prices, and customer reviews.
Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy are utilized to build the web scraper.
The scraped data can be leveraged for market analysis, competitor research, or price tracking.

# COVID Data Exploration using SQL:
In this project, SQL queries are employed to explore COVID-19 data.
The dataset used consists of reliable information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations, obtained from reputable public health organizations or government databases.
By importing the dataset into a SQL database, meaningful insights are derived through SQL queries, such as aggregating statistics, visualizing trends, and generating reports.

# Data Cleaning using SQL:
This project focuses on the importance of data cleaning for ensuring data quality and accuracy.
SQL queries are employed to clean and preprocess raw datasets, addressing common data cleaning tasks like handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and resolving inconsistencies.
The project provides practical examples of SQL queries and operations for efficient and effective data cleaning.

# Data Visualization using Python:
This project centers around visualizing data using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
Various techniques for data visualization, including line charts, bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps, are employed to present insights and patterns in the data.
The project demonstrates how to create visually appealing and informative visualizations to facilitate data analysis and communication.

# Tableau SQL Queries:
This project showcases the utilization of SQL queries within Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool.
SQL queries are written and integrated with Tableau to extract, transform, and analyze data from diverse sources.
The project demonstrates how to leverage Tableau's capabilities to visualize and explore data using SQL queries.
The Data-Analysis-Toolkit repository serves as a comprehensive resource for individuals interested in various facets of data analysis. By covering a wide range of techniques and tools, it offers practical examples and guidance for executing data-related tasks effectively and deriving meaningful insights from different datasets.
